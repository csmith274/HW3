# HW3

Cameron Smith


I installed truffle version 4.1.10 and openzepplin-solidity version 1.12 in order to get the version numbers of solidity 
and the file paths of the imports to match.

I changed the investorMinCap value for question #1 and added the getTokensLeft function for #2. I was unable to test the function so 
I don't know if it works.
